# Predictive Modeling: Diabetes

This report utilizes a cleaned and consolidated dataset from the BRFSS 2015 dataset that is available on Kaggle. Several data transformations, analyses, tests, and comparisons were conducted to investigate the predictors of diabetes health risks using BRFSSâ€™s Annual Survey data in 2015. The findings revealed that three components of the diabetes health indicator dataset significantly influenced the prediction of an individual's likelihood of having diabetes. These components include General Health, High Blood Pressure, and Difficulty Walking.
